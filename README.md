# Hi, I'm Chouaib Benchraka 👋

**Data Scientist | Computing Sciences (Data Science) MSc | Research & Omics Background**

I’m a data scientist with a Master’s degree in Computing Sciences – Data Science (2024) and experience as a research assistant in a data science / bioinformatics group.  
I’ve worked on **metagenomics and multi-omics**, **survival analysis**, and **reproducible pipelines** using **R, Python, Shell, Snakemake, and HPC (SLURM)**.

## 🔧 Tech & Tools

**Languages:**  
- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib/seaborn)  
- R (tidyverse, survival, glmnet, caret / tidymodels)  
- Shell scripting (Bash)  

**Machine Learning & Statistics:**  
- Supervised learning (classification, regression)  
- Survival analysis (Cox models, regularization, risk scores)  
- Model evaluation, cross-validation, feature engineering  
- Experimental design, statistical inference  

**Data Workflows & Tooling:**  
- SQL (learning & practicing)  
- Data wrangling & EDA  
- Snakemake workflows, reproducible pipelines  
- HPC (SLURM), job arrays, resource management  
- Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration  

**Dev & Reproducibility:**  
- Conda / virtualenv  
- Docker (basics)  
- Jupyter / RMarkdown / Quarto  
- Documentation and clean project structure

## 📌 Featured Projects

- **Battery diagnostics from impedance data**  
  **Repository:** [`battery-diagnostics-impedance-ml-examples`](https://github.com/ChouaibB/battery-diagnostics-impedance-ml-examples)  
  A compact set of Jupyter notebooks on lithium-ion battery diagnostics from electrochemical impedance (EIS) data. Focus areas include:
  - engineering features from impedance spectra and simple ECM-style summaries,  
  - training regression models for state-of-charge (SoC) and state-of-health (SoH),  
  - healthy vs aged cell classification with group-aware validation by battery.  

- **Wearable activity recognition & physiology ML**  
  **Repository:** [`wearable-physiology-ml-notebooks`](https://github.com/ChouaibB/wearables-ml-examples)  
  A growing collection of clean, end-to-end Jupyter notebooks demonstrating applied machine learning on wearable sensor data (IMU, PPG, physiology):
  - human activity recognition from wrist IMU data (PAMAP2) using windowed features and subject-wise cross-validation,  


- **Microbiome-based survival analysis (MSc thesis)**  
  **Repository:** [`microbiome-survival-comparison`](https://github.com/ChouaibB/microbiome-survival-comparison)  
  Code and analysis from my MSc thesis _“Comparison of Microbiome-Based Survival Analysis Methods”_.  
  - End-to-end R-based workflow for microbiome-driven survival modelling with multiple endpoints and taxonomies.  
  - Realistic HPC usage (SLURM-style job submission) and reproducible project structure.  
  - Feature selection, model comparison, and scripts for generating thesis-style figures and tables.  

> These are currently my main public projects and concrete examples of how I structure and document applied ML and research-style analyses.
