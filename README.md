# Hi, I'm Chouaib Benchraka 👋

**Data Scientist | Computing Sciences (Data Science) MSc | Research & Omics Background**

I’m a data scientist with a Master’s degree in Computing Sciences – Data Science (2024) and experience as a research assistant in a data science / bioinformatics group.  
I’ve worked on **metagenomics and multi-omics**, **survival analysis**, and **reproducible pipelines** using **R, Python, Shell, Snakemake, and HPC (SLURM)**.

I’m now focusing on transitioning into an **industry data scientist role**, building projects that show clear business value, solid engineering practices, and clean communication.

## 🔧 Tech & Tools

**Languages:**  
- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib/seaborn)  
- R (tidyverse, survival, glmnet, caret / tidymodels)  
- Shell scripting (Bash)  

**Machine Learning & Statistics:**  
- Supervised learning (classification, regression)  
- Survival analysis (Cox models, regularization, risk scores)  
- Model evaluation, cross-validation, feature engineering  
- Experimental design, statistical inference  

**Data & Engineering:**  
- SQL (learning & practicing)  
- Data wrangling & EDA  
- Snakemake workflows, reproducible pipelines  
- HPC (SLURM), job arrays, resource management  
- Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration  

**Dev & Reproducibility:**  
- Conda / virtualenv  
- Docker (basics)  
- Jupyter / RMarkdown / Quarto  
- Documentation and clean project structure

## 🌟 Upcoming Projects

> _These are the projects I’m currently building and polishing._

- In progress: **[Business ML Project – e.g. Customer Churn Prediction](#)**  
  End-to-end machine learning project: from exploratory data analysis to model training and evaluation, with a focus on explainability and business-ready insights.

- In progress: **[Data Engineering / SQL Project – e.g. Analytics Pipeline](#)**  
  SQL + data engineering–style project: building a small data model, writing analytical queries, and exposing metrics that a business stakeholder would care about.

- In progress: **[Survival / Omics Project – e.g. Multi-omics Survival Analysis](#)**  
  Survival analysis project using real or realistic omics-like data. Includes feature preprocessing, model fitting (e.g. Cox models), and interpretation of risk scores.

- In progress: **[Reproducible Pipeline – e.g. Snakemake + HPC Workflow](#)**  
  A compact example of a reproducible data/ML pipeline using Snakemake on HPC/SLURM, demonstrating good practices for research and production-grade workflows.

> I’m gradually polishing and documenting these projects so they are easy to read, run, and evaluate.

## 📚 Research Background (Bioinformatics / Omics)

Previously, I worked as a **Research Assistant** in a data science / bioinformatics group, focusing on:

- Metagenomics and multi-omics data integration  
- Survival analysis and risk modeling  
- Reproducible, scalable workflows (Snakemake, HPC, Git)

Where possible, I share **sanitized or simulated versions** of this work to demonstrate my approach without exposing confidential data.

## 🔭 What I’m Working on Now

- Building a **business-oriented ML project** with a lightweight deployment (e.g. API or simple app).
- Creating a **data engineering / SQL–focused project** to showcase data modeling and query skills.
- Designing a **flagship survival / omics analysis** project that reflects my research strengths in an industry-friendly format.
- Sharpening my **Python, SQL, and MLOps** skills, while keeping my R and statistics toolkit strong.

## 🤝 Collaboration & Contact

I’m open to roles such as **Junior Data Scientist**, **Data Analyst (with ML focus)**, or **Bioinformatics / Data Scientist**.
